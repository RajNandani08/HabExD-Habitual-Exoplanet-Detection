# HabExD-Habitual-Exoplanet-Detection
HabExD is a research project focused on predicting and detecting habitable exoplanets through the integration of advanced Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms. Utilizing techniques such as Decision Tree Classifier, Tensorflow Decision Forest, Multilayer Perceptron, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), the project aims to enhance the accuracy of habitable exoplanet identification.The datasets sourced from NASA Exoplanets Archive and Kepler form the foundation for this exploration. Beyond detection, HabExD conducts in-depth calculations and analyses to uncover correlations between planetary features—such as orbital velocity, radial velocity, and average temperature—and habitability, aims to enhance the accuracy of habitable exoplanet identification. This research not only contributes to the identification of habitable exoplanets but also provides valuable insights for researchers seeking to understand the nuances of sustainable atmospheres akin to Earth. The project stands as a crucial step towards unraveling undiscovered details about our position in the universe.
